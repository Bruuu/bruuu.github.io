              Hey, thanks for stopping by. My name is Kristina and I am the
              person behind the blog. üëã
            </p>
            <p>
              Born and raised in Russia, I moved to Australia one day. I gave up
              and went back to Software Development a few times. I worked in big
              companies, startups and ran small businesses on my own. Apart from
              programming, I was a travel blogger, videographer, pet sitter,
              housewife and even watercolour artist. It‚Äôs been an amazing
              journey that made me who I am.
              <p>
                Currently, I‚Äôm a Junior Web Developer, working remotely in an
                amazing team. My code is mostly in{" "}
                <span className="italic">JavaScript(React)</span> and I'm
                learning <span className="italic"> Elixir</span>.

            <h2>Three random facts about me:</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The very first console I opened by pressing{" "}
                <span className="italic">‚ÄúCtrl + Shift + C‚Äù</span> was the Cheat
                Console in the Sims2. Yeap, the first code I wrote was the code
                for making my Sim rich and immortal, haha! Back that time I had
                no Internet in my home yet managed to get a piece of paper with
                the magical codes from the right person. ü§ì
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Knowing only Russian and German I struggled a lot in the
                  University. Writing my first programs in Pascal or C++ with
                  all those{" "}
                  <span className="italic">
                    for, else, while, write, count, char, etc
                  </span>{" "}
                  words, ugh. I had no idea they were not gibberish but real
                  English words! ü§£
                </p>
                <p>
                  Little did I know that I would move to English speaking
                  country after all.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                The best advice I‚Äôve ever been given was{" "}
                <span className="italic">‚ÄúFind a mentor‚Äù</span>. Seriously, that
                changed my life.

            <h2>What is the purpose of my blog?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                First of all, I want to give support to my readers. Especially,
                to the ones that just started their career in Software
                Development or thinking about it.
              </li>
              <li>
                I want to document and structure my experience here and share
                some tips and tricks with others.
              </li>
              <li>
                The blog is not just about technical stuff but how to improve
                the problem-solving, leadership, and consulting skills as well.
                I truly believe you need all of these skills to become a Senior
                Developer and that is my goal now.
