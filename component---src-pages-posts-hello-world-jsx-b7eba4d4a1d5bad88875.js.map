Thanks for stopping by and welcome to my blog!</p>\n\n            <p>You may wonder who the hell are you?</p>\n\n            <p>\n              My name is Kristina. Born and raised in Russia, I learned to smile\n              and trust strangers in Australia. I gave up and went back to\n              software development a few times. It’s been an amazing journey\n              that made me who I am now. I worked in big companies, startups and\n              ran small businesses on my own. I was a travel blogger,\n              videographer, pet sitter, housewife and even watercolour artist.\n              Currently, I’m a Junior Web Developer, working remotely in an\n              amazing team. My code is mostly in JS(React) and I learn Elixir.{\" \"}\n            </p>\n\n            <p>Three random facts about me</p>\n\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                The very first console I opened by pressing “Ctrl + Shift + C”\n                was the Cheat Console in the Sims 2. Yeap, the first code I\n                wrote was the code for making my sim rich and immortal! Back\n                that time I had no Internet in my home yet managed to get a\n                piece of paper with the magical codes from the right person. I\n                loved trying new things so had to learn how to fix the Blue\n                Screens of Death too.{\" \"}\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Knowing only Russian and German I struggled a lot in the\n                University. Writing my first programs in Pascal or C++ with all\n                those “for, else, while, write, count, char, etc“ words I had no\n                idea they were not a gibberish but real English words(!) Oh,\n                little did I know that I would move to English speaking country\n                after all.{\" \"}\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                “Find a mentor” is the best advice you’ve ever been given. And\n                because of that I started my own technical blog.\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>What is the purpose of my blog?</p>\n\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                First of all, I want to give support to my readers. Especially,\n                to the ones that just started their carrier in Software\n                Development or thinking about it.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                I want to document and structure my experience here and share\n                some tips and tricks with others.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                The blog is not just about technical stuff but how to improve\n                the problem-solving, leadership, and consulting skills as well.\n                I truly believe you need all of these skills to become a Senior\n                Developer and that is my goal now.\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>\n              Does any of that sound interesting for you?
